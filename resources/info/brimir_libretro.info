# Notes
notes = "(!) Brimir requires a Sega Saturn BIOS (IPL ROM) to function.|BIOS files should be placed in the frontend's system directory.|The core will automatically select the appropriate BIOS based on game region.|For multi-disc games, use M3U playlist files.|This is an experimental core based on the Ymir emulator."

description = "Brimir is a libretro core adaptation of the Ymir Sega Saturn emulator. It provides accurate Sega Saturn emulation with modern features including save states, rewind, and graphics enhancements. The core supports multiple disc formats (CHD, BIN/CUE, ISO) and automatically handles region switching. Based on Ymir's modern C++20 codebase, Brimir aims to provide a high-quality Saturn emulation experience within the libretro ecosystem."
