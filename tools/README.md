# Brimir tools

## brimir_bench — headless frame benchmark

Runs real content without a frontend and reports host time per frame and the
share of emulation time spent in each SH-2 CPU. Used for the SH-2 JIT baseline
(`design/sh2-baseline.md`) and for before/after comparisons.

Build:

```powershell
cmake --build build --target brimir_bench
```

Run `brimir_bench --help` for all options.

Benchmark a game from boot (no controller input, so it stays on the title or
attract screens):

```powershell
build\bin\brimir_bench.exe --bios system\sega_101.bin --game "D:\Saturn\Game.cue" --system-dir system --frames 1800
```

`--system-dir` must point to a directory that holds a configured
`brimir_saturn_rtc_<jp|us_eu>.smpc` (BIOS language and clock settings, STE=1),
for example the RetroArch system folder after running any game once with
Brimir and completing the BIOS language/clock setup. The file name depends on
the BIOS region. Without it the BIOS stops at its first-boot setup screen,
waits for input, and never boots the disc (the slave SH-2 then reports
0.000 ms). If `--system-dir` is omitted, the per-run temp directory is used,
which is always unconfigured. The core may write updated RTC settings back into
the system directory, as it does under RetroArch.

Backup RAM (`.srm`) and cartridge RAM (`.cart`) are written to a fresh
directory under `%TEMP%\brimir_bench\run-*` that is removed on exit, so saves
from earlier runs never affect results.

Benchmark gameplay: create a save state at the point of interest, then measure
from it. `--dump-at` runs N frames from the loaded content (and optional
`--state`) and writes the core's raw state data:

```powershell
build\bin\brimir_bench.exe --bios system\sega_101.bin --game Game.cue --system-dir system --dump-at 3600 --dump-state game.bstate
build\bin\brimir_bench.exe --bios system\sega_101.bin --game Game.cue --system-dir system --state game.bstate --frames 1800
```

RetroArch `.state` files are accepted only if they contain the raw core data
(no RetroArch container header, no compression); otherwise loading fails with an
error.

Output:

```
content      : Game.cue
frames       : 1800 (warmup 120)
ms/frame     : avg 7.912  p50 7.804  p95 9.120  p99 10.301  max 14.022
fps (host)   : 126.4
Ymir_RunFrame: 7.850 ms/frame
SH2 master   : 3.120 ms/frame (39.7% of Ymir_RunFrame)
SH2 slave    : 1.004 ms/frame (12.8% of Ymir_RunFrame)
SH2 total    : 4.124 ms/frame (52.5% of Ymir_RunFrame)
```

SH-2 time is measured inside `SH2::Advance` and includes on-chip peripherals
(DMA, timers) and bus accesses the CPUs make. VDP rendering runs on worker
threads by default, so `Ymir_RunFrame` is the emulation thread's time only.

Exit codes: 0 success (including `--help`), 1 usage error (usage is printed to
stderr), 2 load or setup failure (BIOS, game, state, missing `--system-dir`,
temp directory errors).
